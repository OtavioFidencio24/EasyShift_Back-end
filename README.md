# EasyShift

Backend system built with Java and Spring Boot to manage weekly employee shift schedules.

---

## Project Description

This project was born out of a real-world need identified by my manager, who struggled to manage weekly staff schedules
using either paid applications or manually on paper (A4 sheets) to avoid subscription costs. As a backend developer, 
I decided to create a web-based system to help solve her problem in a more efficient and organized way. This initiative
not only aims to provide a free and practical solution for her daily operations, but also serves as a valuable 
opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience in developing and delivering real-world software solutions.
